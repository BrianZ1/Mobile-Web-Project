       Autumn is often associated with certain decorations, including cornucopias,
       garlands, straw, or grapevine wreaths, and dried flower arrangements. Although
       many decorations can be bought ready-made, making your own can be a fun
       family activity for a fall afternoon.

    <p>
        For the cornucopia, which signifies a bountiful harvest with plenty to eat,
        you'll need the traditional horn-shaped basket (available at most craft or basket
        shop); shellac or paint; real, dried or artificial fruit and vegetables; pine
        cones; and plant materials. Paint or shellac the basket before you begin,
        allowing plenty of time to dry, before you fill with your choice of items.
        Be creative!

        Another decoration appropriate for the fall season is a straw grapevine wreath.
        Hop vines work great, too! Again, supplies are available at craft shops. Wrap
        the wreath with colorful ribbon, covering the entire surface, or loosely wrap
        it, leaving sections exposed. Then add the finishing touches--a colorful bow,
        a few sprigs of wheat, or a cluster of fruit.
